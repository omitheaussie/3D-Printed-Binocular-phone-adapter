I have a pair of Canon image stabilised binoculars. I wanted to see if I can get good photos
using these binoculars. Just holding the phone camera to the eyepiece is very cumbersome and 
doesnt work. So I carefully measured the binocular geometry and modelled a bracket in
Unigraphics and 3D printed it. And it worked wonders!!!
